# nosql-demo
This is a small repo for some very simple exercise / demos for usage of a NoSQL DB - [pouchdb](https://pouchdb.com/)

## Exercise

To be added

## Folder Structure
You can find all the source files you need under `src` folder.

In particular, you might want to look at `/src/typescript/systemDesignExercise.ts`, `/src/typescript/systemDesignExercise.test.ts`,`/src/typescript/playground.ts` and `/src/typescript/fileBasedDatabaseExamples.ts`.

Feel free to ignore the other files such as `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `jest.config.js` for now (mainly for project configuration)
